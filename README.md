This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run this project

First, clone backend REST API project into your computer from this repository provided by NinjaRMM:

[https://github.com/NinjaMSP/devicesTask_serverApp.git](https://github.com/NinjaMSP/devicesTask_serverApp.git)

In the backend project directory, please run:
##### `npm install`
##### `npm start`

Which runs the backend server in your localhost. You can try it by opening [http://localhost:3000/devices](http://localhost:3000/devices) in your browser.

##
To run the client frontend app developed in React as solution to this task, clone this repository to your computer and run:
##### `npm install`
##### `npm start`

As the backend project must be now running on port 3000, cli will ask you to run in other port (3001). 

`Type "Y" to confirm execution on port 3001.`

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.
